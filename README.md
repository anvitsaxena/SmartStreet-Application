# SmartTree-Application
Smart Street is an Android application which uses Barcode and QR Code Scanner to scan the Smart trees in any street. 
It is developed using Android Studio and is part of my submission for my Course CMPE 235 - Mobile based System design.

To run this application:
Download and install Android Studio and import this project.
Build gradle and update all the dependencies as suggested by Android Studio. 
Note: This application will run better in an Android device rather than Emulator as it needs to access camera and location.
